# Alpha Versioned (in development)
Finish the game you're playing bc the devs are just too lazy to finish it for you.

## Context
You, the player of the game must finish the game using the tools that the devs are giving you, because they're too lazy and need to "work" for a living.

You are not going to let them go bankrupt, right? I thought so.
